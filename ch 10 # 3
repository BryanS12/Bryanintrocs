#Write a function called makeRandRange(numVals, start, end, seed=None) that creates and returns a list containing a specified number of 
random integers in a range between start (inclusive) and end (exclusive) (use iteration, append, and the random module).

#NOTE: The parameter seed is an optional parameter. In your own code, you do not need to provide the 4th parameter seed when you call the 
function. It is OK to just call the function as makeRandRange(numVals, start, end).

#Write another function called average that will take the list created by makeRandRange (or any list of numbers in factâ€¦) as a parameter 
and return its average. def average(numList):
   
    a= 0 
    for i in numList:
        a += i
    l = a/len(numList)
    
    return l      

def makeRandRange(numVals, start, end, seed=None):
    random.seed(seed) 
    new = []
    for i in range(numVals):
        a = random.randrange(start, end)
        new.append(a)
    return new
   


print(makeRandRange( 20 , 1, 5))
